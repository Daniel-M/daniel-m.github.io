      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to write about character sets and encodings for a while, since I had problems in the past understanding what is it all about?
Words and information When reading this, all you are seeing is an arrangement of characters disposed in a certain way that they are meaningful to you. &amp;ndash; for instance &amp;ldquo;blank&amp;rdquo; separations between words are an indication of different words &amp;ndash; so this give us an idea that, the way in which symbols are disposed mean something.</description>

      <description>Recently I was working with hashing some files in order to take checksums to avoid working with data-corrupted files received at the endpoint of a web server. It sounds easy, receive the file, calculate the hash, and emit the response. I only needed something like hash = calculate_hash(file).
A five minute research on duckduckgo lead me to write the following code,
import hashlib def calculate_hash(filepath, chunk_size=4096, hash_method=hashlib.md5()): hasher = hash_method with open(filepath, &amp;#39;rb&amp;#39;) as fp: buffer = fp.</description>
