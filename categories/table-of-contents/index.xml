      <description>Motivation One of my hobbies during my school days was electronics after learning about B.E.A.M robots during a Popular Mechanics for Kids episode. You can learn more about B.E.A.M. here
During my University years I had the opportunity to refine my knowledge on basic electronics, and exploit my programming skills programming Arduino and Microchip microcontrollers (a.k.a MCUs). Those where days filled with fun, but I still wanted to be able to send data to remote locations, which could be possible by means of a RaspberryPI, or a GSM module or Bluetooth module &amp;ndash;which were expensive&amp;ndash; or having the Arduino/MCU connected to a regular computer with internet, so the whole point of small devices was not really possible at that time in terms of a good efficiency/cost relation.</description>
